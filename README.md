# PaperRockScissors

PaperRockScissors game is a second component of bigger application.
This application is my first project in C# and XAML. I'm still learning so I think that it will be possible to improve this minigame in future.

How can you start my minigame?
You need to download my repository as a .zip file or clone it. 
The easiest way is to go to the bin/Debug/ folder and run TicTacToe.exe. This way you don't need any software to run the game.
Another way is open TicTacToe.sln file but you need Visual Studio Community 2019(can also be Enterprise or Proffesional). 
After opening the application, you can press CTRL+F5 (the default shortcut to run the program).

PS:
I have currently finished working on a larger app, the minigames are ugly but working, so everything will be possible to improve in the future.
